Front-end built with React. Also, used Axios and uuid version 4.

I started on my recipe project with a different repository. I became very frustrated and decided to trash that version. Unfortunately, life has not worked in my favor since the beginning of the final project. I am still working full-time with 5 children. I knew it would be tough... However, this last two weeks has brought my daughter's final volleyball game ever(they are seniors) a trip to Montana and back to take parts and help with repairs on a truck, halloween, and having to get the cattle out of pasture per the land owner due to the extended drought.

I have run into a Cors issue so the API I used does not even work. I have spent too much time on that. I have not even finished any routes. I did push it to Heroku but it does not do anything but show the initial page. I set up the database in Mongoose but did not connect it.
