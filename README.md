I started on my recipe project with a different repository. I became very frustrated and decided to trash that version. Unfortunately, life has not worked in my favor since the beginning of the final project. I am still working full-time with 5 children. I knew it would be tough... However, these last two weeks have brought my daughters' final volleyball game ever(they are seniors) a trip to Montana and back to take parts and help with repairs on a truck, halloween, and having to get the cattle out of pasture per the land owners due to the extended drought. I just plain need more time. The career I had hoped to go into on completion of this bootcamp is now a distant dream. I can not give up a paying job to have time for more practice. I just keep telling myself I WILL GET THERE SOMEDAY.

I have run into a Cors issue so the API I used does not even work. I have spent too much time on that. I have not even finished any routes. I did push it to Heroku but it does not do anything but show the initial page. I set up the database in Mongoose but did not connect it.
